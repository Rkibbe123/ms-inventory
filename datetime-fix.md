# IMMEDIATE FIX: Disable Force Device Login Route

## Issue Found
The 500 error is caused by this line in `/app/app/main.py` line 820:
```python
"created_at": datetime.datetime.now()
```

Should be:
```python
"created_at": datetime.now()
```

## Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Use Main Page Only (Immediate)
- Avoid clicking "Force Device Login" link
- Use the regular main page form with "Use Device Login" checkbox
- This works perfectly and has all the same functionality

### Option 2: Remove the Link Temporarily
In Azure Portal Container App console, you could edit the main.py file to comment out the Force Device Login link:

1. Go to Container Apps → azure-resource-inventory
2. Go to "Console" 
3. Edit `/app/app/main.py`
4. Find line ~176 and comment out the Force Device Login link

### Option 3: Wait for Docker Fix
Once Docker connectivity improves, we'll push v4.2 with the datetime fix.

## Current Working Features
✅ Main page loads perfectly  
✅ "Use Device Login" checkbox works  
✅ Run button validation works  
✅ Security messaging displays correctly  
✅ Regular device login authentication works  

**Recommendation**: Just use the main page - it has identical functionality to the Force Device Login page!
