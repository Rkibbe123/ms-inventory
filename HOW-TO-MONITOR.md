### üîç Method 3: Azure CLI Direct Commands

**Check Container Status:**
```powershell
az containerapp show `
  --name ms-inventory `
  --resource-group rg-rkibbe-2470 `
  --query "properties.runningStatus"
```

**View Recent Logs (last 50 lines):**
```powershell
az containerapp logs show `
  --name ms-inventory `
  --resource-group rg-rkibbe-2470 `
  --tail 50
```

**Stream Live Logs (follow mode):**

### üåê Method 4: HTTP API Endpoints

You can use `Invoke-WebRequest` or `curl` to check status:

**Check PowerShell Jobs:**

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://azure-resource-inventory.ambitiousbeach-c62b6a92.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io/check-jobs" | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Content
```

**Check Generated Files:**
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://azure-resource-inventory.ambitiousbeach-c62b6a92.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io/debug-files" | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Content
```

1. Go to https://portal.azure.com
2. Navigate to **Resource Groups** ‚Üí **rg-rkibbe-2470**
3. Click on **ms-inventory** (Container App)

## What To Look For

### ‚úÖ Good Signs:
- **"Resource Jobs Still Running: X"** - Jobs are processing
- **Job count decreasing** - Jobs are completing
- **Files appearing in /outputs** - Reports are being generated
- **Regular log updates** - Activity is happening

### ‚è≥ Normal Behavior:
- **Takes 10-30 minutes** for large environments
- **Some jobs take longer** than others
- **Log output pauses** during processing (normal)
- **"Connecting to stream..."** may show while waiting for output

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning Signs:
- **No updates for 5+ minutes** - May be stuck
- **High failed job count** - Check for errors
- **Authentication errors** - Need to re-authenticate

### ‚ùå Problems:
- **Container stopped** - Needs restart
- **All jobs failed** - Check permissions
- **No files after 30+ min** - Check logs for errors

## Troubleshooting Tips

### If Nothing is Showing:
1. Check if inventory scan has been started from web interface
2. Verify container is running: `.\check-status-simple.ps1`
3. Check for errors in logs: `az containerapp logs show --name ms-inventory --resource-group rg-rkibbe-2470 --tail 100`

### If It Seems Stuck:
1. Watch the progress: `.\watch-progress.ps1`
2. Look for "Resource Jobs Still Running" messages
3. Be patient - large environments can take 30+ minutes
4. The process may appear quiet during processing phases

### If You See Errors:
1. Get detailed job info: `.\get-job-details.ps1`
2. Check container logs for stack traces
3. Verify Azure permissions for the managed identity
4. Try restarting the scan from the web interface

## Current Status of Your Scan

Based on your screenshot earlier, your scan showed:
- ‚úÖ Jobs were being created successfully
- ‚úÖ Processing was active (160 jobs running)
- ‚úÖ Various resource types were being scanned (Analytics, ComputeD, DatabaseD, etc.)
- ‚è≥ Scan had been running for 2+ minutes

**This is normal!** The scan is progressing. Give it 10-30 minutes to complete.
