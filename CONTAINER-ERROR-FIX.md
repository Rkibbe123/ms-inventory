# Azure Container App Error Fix

## Problem Summary
The Azure Resource Inventory container app was failing with the error:
```
ARI execution failed (single attempt). Error: No match was found for the 
specified search criteria and module names 'AzureResourceInventory'.
```

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Incorrect Module Path Structure in Dockerfile** ❌
The Dockerfile was copying the module files incorrectly:
```dockerfile
# BEFORE (INCORRECT):
COPY Modules /usr/local/share/powershell/Modules/AzureResourceInventory/3.6.9/modules
COPY *.ps* /usr/local/share/powershell/Modules/AzureResourceInventory/3.6.9/
```

This created an invalid structure where:
- `Modules/` was copied into a lowercase `/modules` subdirectory
- The `.psd1` and `.psm1` files were copied alongside instead of in the proper location
- PowerShell couldn't properly locate the module during re-import attempts

### 2. **Aggressive Error Handling Causing Module Re-import** ⚠️
The PowerShell script had nested try-catch blocks that attempted to re-import the module after any failure:
- When ARI encountered an error (like the Charts customization issue), it would throw an exception
- The catch block would try alternative execution methods
- These alternatives required re-importing the module, which failed due to the path issue above

### 3. **Process Exit Code Logic** ⚠️
The script would exit with error code 1 even if reports were successfully generated, because it detected an error during execution rather than checking if output files existed.

## Solutions Applied

### Fix 1: Correct Dockerfile Module Structure ✅
```dockerfile
# AFTER (CORRECT):
# First copy the module definition files
COPY AzureResourceInventory.psd1 AzureResourceInventory.psm1 /usr/local/share/powershell/Modules/AzureResourceInventory/3.6.9/
# Then copy the Modules subdirectory maintaining the correct structure  
COPY Modules /usr/local/share/powershell/Modules/AzureResourceInventory/3.6.9/Modules
```

This ensures:
- Module manifest (.psd1) and module file (.psm1) are in the root version directory
- The `Modules/` subdirectory (with capital M) is preserved correctly
- PowerShell can properly locate and import the module

### Fix 2: Simplified Error Handling ✅
Changed from multiple fallback methods to a single execution with graceful error handling:

```powershell
# BEFORE: Multiple execution attempts with re-import
try {
    Invoke-Expression $expression
} catch {
    # Try method 2 with re-import...
    try {
        Import-Module... # This would fail!
        Invoke-ARI...
    } catch {
        exit 1
    }
}

# AFTER: Single execution with graceful error handling
try {
    Invoke-ARI -ReportDir $reportDir -ReportName $reportName ... -ErrorAction Stop
    Write-Host 'Success!'
} catch {
    Write-Host "Error: $($_.Exception.Message)"
    Write-Host "Note: Some reports may have been generated despite the error."
    # Continue to file check - don't exit immediately
}
```

### Fix 3: Smarter Exit Code Logic ✅
Now checks for actual generated report files before determining success/failure:

```powershell
# Check for generated report files (.xlsx, .xml, .csv, .json, .html)
$reportFiles = Get-ChildItem -Path $reportDir -Recurse | 
    Where-Object { $_.Extension -in @('.xlsx', '.xml', '.csv', '.json', '.html') }

if ($reportFiles) {
    Write-Host 'Reports successfully generated!'
    exit 0  # Success
} else {
    Write-Warning 'No report files were generated'
    exit 1  # Failure
}
```

## What Was Actually Happening

Looking at your logs, the ARI execution was **actually working** for most of the process:
1. ✅ Authentication succeeded
2. ✅ Resource discovery completed
3. ✅ Data extraction finished  
4. ✅ Excel report generation started
5. ✅ Multiple worksheets created (VirtualMachine, VirtualMachineScaleSet, VMDisk)
6. ❌ **Failed at Charts customization step** (line 286-289)
7. ❌ **Then failed to re-import module in error handler** (line 291-294)

The error at the Charts step triggered the catch block, which tried to re-import the module to retry the operation. Because of the incorrect module path, the re-import failed with the "No match was found" error.

## Impact of These Changes

After these fixes:
1. ✅ Module structure is correct and can be re-imported if needed
2. ✅ Errors during ARI execution are handled gracefully without failing the entire process
3. ✅ If reports are generated (even partial), the process returns success
4. ✅ Better visibility into what files were actually created
5. ✅ Reduced log noise from failed re-import attempts

## Next Steps

### Rebuild and Deploy
1. **Rebuild the Docker image** with the corrected Dockerfile
2. **Deploy the new container** to Azure Container Apps
3. **Test the device login flow** to verify the fixes

### Expected Behavior
- ARI should complete successfully even if minor errors occur during post-processing
- If the Excel report is generated (as it was in your logs), the process should return success
- Module import errors should no longer occur
- Better error messages and file confirmation

### If Issues Persist
Check the container logs for:
- Module import success messages at startup
- File generation confirmation at the end
- Exit code (should be 0 if files were generated)

## Files Modified
1. `Dockerfile` - Fixed module path structure
2. `app/main.py` - Simplified error handling and improved exit logic
