# ✅ Testing Mode Image v6.38 - Ready to Deploy!

## Status
- ✅ **Docker image built** with local modified modules
- ✅ **Image pushed** to Azure Container Registry
- ⏳ **Waiting for deployment** to Container App

## What's Different in v6.38

### Key Changes:
1. **Uses LOCAL modules** (not PowerShell Gallery)
2. **Only processes Compute module** (16 modules → 1 module)
3. **Skips extra jobs** (Draw.io, Security, Policy, Advisory)
4. **Increased timeouts** (3 min per job)
5. **Better progress output** for web interface

### Expected Log Messages:
When you run a scan, you should see:
```
🧪 TESTING MODE: Only processing Compute module for quick validation
🧪 TESTING MODE: Skipping Draw.io Diagram Job
🧪 TESTING MODE: Skipping Security Center Job
🧪 TESTING MODE: Skipping Policy Job
🧪 TESTING MODE: Skipping Advisory Job
✅ Running Subscriptions Processing job (required for output)
⏱️ TIMEOUT SETTINGS: Total=15 min, Per-Job=3 min
```

## Deploy Now

### Option 1: Use the deploy script
```powershell
.\deploy-v6.38.ps1
```

### Option 2: Manual deployment
```powershell
az containerapp update `
    --name ms-inventory `
    --resource-group rg-rkibbe-2470 `
    --image rkazureinventory.azurecr.io/azure-resource-inventory:v6.38
```

### Option 3: Use Azure Portal
1. Go to the screenshot you shared (Containers → Containers page)
2. Change "Image tag" from `v6.36` to `v6.38`
3. Click "Save"

## After Deployment

1. **Start a new scan:**
   - Go to: https://azure-resource-inventory.ambitiousbeach-c62b6a92.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io
   - Click "Run Invoke-ARI"
   - Complete device authentication

2. **Monitor progress:**
   ```powershell
   # Live dashboard
   .\watch-progress.ps1
   
   # Or quick status
   .\check-status-simple.ps1
   
   # Or stream logs
   az containerapp logs show --name ms-inventory --resource-group rg-rkibbe-2470 --follow
   ```

3. **Look for testing indicators:**
   - Should see "🧪 TESTING MODE" messages
   - Should show "Creating Job: Compute" (only 1 job, not 16+)
   - Should complete in 3-5 minutes (not 20+)

## Expected Results

### ✅ Success Case:
- Scan completes in **3-5 minutes**
- Excel file generated with Compute tab
- No hanging or timeout
- **Proves the basic pipeline works!**

### ⚠️ Still Hangs:
- Times out after 3 minutes
- Error messages visible
- **Indicates fundamental issue** (not module-specific)

### 🎯 What We Learn:
- If it works: The issue is with specific modules/jobs
- If it fails: The issue is with core PowerShell job execution
- Either way, we'll have better error info!

## Differences from Previous Runs

| Aspect | Previous (v6.36) | Testing Mode (v6.38) |
|--------|------------------|----------------------|
| Modules | All 16 modules | Only Compute |
| Module Source | PowerShell Gallery | Local modified code |
| Extra Jobs | All enabled | Most disabled |
| Expected Time | 10-30 minutes | 3-5 minutes |
| Job Count | 160+ jobs | 1-2 jobs |
| Testing Indicators | None | "🧪 TESTING MODE" messages |

## Important Notes

⚠️ **This is a testing version!** The output will be limited:
- ✅ Compute resources only
- ❌ No other resource types
- ❌ No diagrams
- ❌ No security analysis
- ❌ No policy analysis

🔄 **To restore full functionality later:**
See `TESTING-MODE-CHANGES.md` for revert instructions

---

**Ready to deploy and test!** 🚀

Once deployed, we'll finally see if the issue is with:
- A) Specific modules causing hangs → Can fix by identifying which one
- B) Core PowerShell job execution → Need different approach
- C) Azure API timeouts → Need to optimize queries

Either way, we'll have much better diagnostic information! 🎯
