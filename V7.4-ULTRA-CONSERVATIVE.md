# Version 7.4 - Ultra-Conservative Stability Mode

## Problem in v7.3
After deploying v7.3, the container hung again with same symptoms as v7.2:
- All 10 jobs showing "Running" but not progressing
- Monitoring loop stuck in first iteration
- Get-Job hang protection working, but jobs themselves frozen
- No output for 5+ minutes

## Root Cause Analysis
The v7.3 improvements (Get-Job timeout, verbose monitoring) were good but didn't address the core issue:
- **10 parallel jobs still too many** for container resource limits (likely 1-2 CPU, 2GB RAM)
- Jobs appear to be **deadlocking or resource-starving** each other
- No mechanism to detect when ALL jobs are stuck (vs individual timeouts)

## v7.4 Changes

### 1. Ultra-Conservative Parallelism (-50% reduction)
**File**: `Modules/Private/2.ProcessingFunctions/Start-ARIProcessJob.ps1`

```powershell
# BEFORE v7.4:
Regular: 10 jobs
Medium: 6 jobs
Large: 4 jobs
Heavy: 4 jobs

# AFTER v7.4:
Regular: 5 jobs  (-50%)
Medium: 4 jobs   (-33%)
Large: 3 jobs    (-25%)
Heavy: 3 jobs    (-25%)
```

**Rationale**: 
- 5 jobs = better CPU scheduling on 1-2 core containers
- Reduces memory pressure
- Less lock contention on PowerShell runspaces

### 2. Deadlock Detection
**File**: `Modules/Public/PublicFunctions/Jobs/Wait-ARIJob.ps1`

Added progress tracking to detect when NO jobs complete:

```powershell
$iterationsSinceProgress = 0
$maxIterationsWithoutProgress = 20  # ~3 minutes

# Track completed job count
if ($completedJobs.Count > $lastCompletionCount) {
    # Progress! Reset counter
    $iterationsSinceProgress = 0
} else {
    # No progress - increment counter
    $iterationsSinceProgress++
    
    if ($iterationsSinceProgress >= 20) {
        # DEADLOCK DETECTED - force stop all jobs
        Write-Warning "No jobs completed in 20 iterations"
        Stop all running jobs
        Break loop
    }
}
```

**How it works**:
- Every 10 seconds, check if any new jobs completed
- If 20 consecutive iterations with zero completions = deadlock
- Force-stop all jobs and exit gracefully

### 3. Enhanced Progress Visibility

Now shows completed job count:
```
Running: 5 | Failed: 0 | Completed: 3
‚úÖ Progress detected: 2 new completions!
```

If stuck:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  NO PROGRESS: 20 iterations without any job completion!
üõë Force-stopping all running jobs due to suspected deadlock...
```

## Expected Behavior

### First Batch (5 jobs):
```
16:31:09 - Creating Job: AI
16:31:09 - Creating Job: Analytics  
16:31:09 - Creating Job: APIs
16:31:09 - Creating Job: Compute
16:31:09 - Creating Job: Container
[Wait for completion: 8-15 minutes]
```

### Second Batch (5 jobs):
```
16:45:00 - Creating Job: Database
16:45:00 - Creating Job: Hybrid
16:45:00 - Creating Job: Integration
16:45:00 - Creating Job: IoT
16:45:00 - Creating Job: Management
[Wait for completion: 8-15 minutes]
```

### Third Batch (6 jobs):
```
16:58:00 - Creating Job: Monitoring
16:58:00 - Creating Job: Network_1
16:58:00 - Creating Job: Network_2
16:58:00 - Creating Job: Security
16:58:00 - Creating Job: Storage
16:58:00 - Creating Job: Web
[Wait for completion: 8-15 minutes]
```

### Total Expected Time
- 3 batches √ó 12 minutes average = **36 minutes**
- Extraction phase: 30 seconds
- Extra jobs (Advisory, Diagram): 5 minutes
- **TOTAL: ~40-45 minutes** (vs 20-30 min target, but STABLE)

## Deployment

```bash
# Build (in progress)
docker build --no-cache -t rkazureinventory.azurecr.io/azure-resource-inventory:v7.4 .

# Push
docker push rkazureinventory.azurecr.io/azure-resource-inventory:v7.4

# Deploy
az containerapp update \
  --name azure-resource-inventory \
  --resource-group ambitiousbeach-rg \
  --image rkazureinventory.azurecr.io/azure-resource-inventory:v7.4
```

## What to Watch For

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators:
- "‚öôÔ∏è  Parallel job limit set to 5 (v7.4: ultra-conservative mode)"
- "‚úÖ Progress detected: X new completions!"
- Jobs completing in batches
- No "NO PROGRESS" warnings

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning Signs:
- "‚ö†Ô∏è  NO PROGRESS: 20 iterations without any job completion!"
- All 5 jobs stuck at same percentage
- "üõë Force-stopping all running jobs due to suspected deadlock"

### üî¥ If Still Hanging:
Next steps would be:
1. **Sequential mode** (1 job at a time) - slowest but most stable
2. **Investigate resource module scripts** - may have Azure API call issues
3. **Container resource limits** - increase CPU/memory allocation

## Tradeoff Analysis

| Version | Parallel Jobs | Expected Time | Stability |
|---------|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| v7.2    | 20           | 20 min        | ‚ùå Hangs  |
| v7.3    | 10           | 25 min        | ‚ùå Hangs  |
| v7.4    | 5            | 40 min        | ü§û TBD    |

**Philosophy**: Better to complete slowly than fail fast.

## Additional Notes

- Get-Job hang protection from v7.3 **retained**
- Verbose per-job monitoring from v7.3 **retained**
- Timeout settings unchanged (20 min total, 5 min per-job)
- All 16 resource modules still enabled
- No changes to resource module scripts themselves

If v7.4 succeeds, we'll have proven that parallelism was the bottleneck, not the monitoring logic or individual modules.
