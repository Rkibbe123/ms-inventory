## What to Look For in v7.6 Logs

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators

#### 1. Correct Version Message
```
‚öôÔ∏è  Parallel job limit set to 8 (v7.5: optimized for upgraded 2-core container)
```

#### 2. Correct Batch Processing (2 batches of 8 jobs each)
```

```

After first batch completes:
```

```

#### 3. Proper Job Monitoring
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è  No jobs found in current query
DEBUG: 2025-10-08_XX_XX_XX - All jobs completed or cleaned up
DEBUG: 2025-10-08_XX_XX_XX - Jobs Complete.
```
**Note:** Should NOT see "‚ùå Jobs disappeared!" error

#### 4. Excel File Creation
```
Starting to Build Excel Report.
Supported Resource Types: 85
```

Then later:
```
Processing Phase Finished: 00:00:XX:XX:XXX
```

#### 5. Successful Completion
```
‚úÖ Generated report files:
<list of Excel files>
üéâ Reports successfully generated and ready for download!
SUCCESS: Azure Resource Inventory completed with generated reports
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning Signs

#### Jobs Complete Too Quickly (< 5 seconds per batch)
```
17:36:19 - Creating 8 jobs
17:36:22 - Get-Job returned: 0 jobs  ‚ö†Ô∏è Only 3 seconds!
```
**This suggests jobs are failing silently**

#### No Excel File Generated
```
WARNING: Could not find /data/AzureResourceInventory/AzureResourceInventory_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_Report_YYYY-MM-DD_HH_MM.xlsx
```
**This means cache files were empty/invalid**

#### Error Messages
```
Error: Cannot bind argument to parameter 'ExcelPackage' because it is null.
```
**Excel file creation failed**

## Expected Execution Timeline

Based on your local run showing 587 resources:

| Phase | Expected Duration |
|-------|-------------------|
| Extraction | 20-30 seconds |
| Job Processing (Batch 1) | 30-60 seconds |
| Job Processing (Batch 2) | 30-60 seconds |
| Excel Report Building | 20-30 seconds |
| **Total** | **2-3 minutes** |

## Comparison: v7.5 vs v7.6

| Aspect | v7.5 (Previous) | v7.6 (Current) |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Deployed | Yes | Yes |
| Batch Processing | 4 batches (5+5+5+1) | 2 batches (8+8) |
| Batch Continuation | ‚úÖ Fixed | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| Remove-Job | ‚úÖ Fixed | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| Version Message | "v7.5: optimized..." | Same |
| Expected Result | Complete inventory | Complete inventory |

**Note:** v7.6 and v7.5 have the same code fixes. v7.6 was just a rebuild to ensure all changes were properly included.

## Troubleshooting

### If Jobs Still Complete in 2-3 Seconds

This is **NOT** a batch continuation issue. Possible causes:

1. **Resource Extraction Failure**
   - Check: "Extracting First 1000 Resources" should find resources
   - Look for: "Number of Resource Containers: XXX" (should be > 0)

2. **Authentication Issue**
   - Check: "Already authenticated in Tenant..." should appear
   - Look for: "Subscription name" listing

3. **Job Script Errors**
   - Jobs may be failing silently without logging errors
   - Check cache files for content: `/data/AzureResourceInventory/ReportCache/*.json`

4. **Resource Count Mismatch**
   - Your local run shows 587 resources
   - Container should extract similar count
   - If extraction shows "Number of Resources: 0", there's a problem

### If Excel File Still Missing

1. Check if cache files exist and have content
2. Verify jobs actually ran (look for job IDs in logs)
3. Check for PowerShell errors during job execution
4. Verify ImportExcel module loaded correctly

## Next Actions

### 1. Trigger New Run
Start a fresh inventory run through the web interface

### 2. Monitor Logs
Watch for the success indicators listed above

### 3. Check Results
- Visit the outputs page
- Download the generated Excel file
- Verify it contains all ~587 resources
- Check for 30+ worksheets

### 4. Report Back
Share the log output showing:
- Version message (should say v7.5 optimized...)
- Job creation (should show 8 jobs in batch 1)
- Job completion times
- Excel file generation result
