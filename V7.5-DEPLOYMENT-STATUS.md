# v7.5 Deployment Status

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ DEPLOYED  
**Image:** `rkazureinventory.azurecr.io/azure-resource-inventory:v7.5`  
**Digest:** `sha256:ca8feaa132a1912e65bd9ad6fab573c9654b203ef44d660dad50cfd49d461c65`

## Container Configuration
- **Resource Group:** `rg-rkibbe-2470`
- **Container App:** `azure-resource-inventory`
- **CPU:** 2.0 cores (upgraded)
- **Memory:** 4Gi (upgraded)

## v7.5 Changes

### 1. Batch Continuation Fix
**File:** `Modules/Public/PublicFunctions/Jobs/Wait-ARIJob.ps1`  
**Lines:** 101-109

**Problem:** When jobs completed, `Get-Job` returned empty array, triggering "Jobs disappeared!" error that broke the parent loop and prevented subsequent batches from being created.

**Solution:** Changed from error condition to normal completion:
```powershell
# OLD (v7.4):
if ($null -eq $jb) {
    Write-Host "‚ùå Jobs disappeared during monitoring!" -ForegroundColor Red
    Write-Warning "Jobs disappeared during monitoring!"
    break
}

# NEW (v7.5):
if ($null -eq $jb -or $jb.Count -eq 0) {
    Write-Host "‚ÑπÔ∏è  No jobs found in current query" -ForegroundColor Yellow
    break  # Normal completion, just exit
}
```

### 2. Remove-Job Force Flag
**File:** `Modules/Private/2.ProcessingFunctions/Build-ARICacheFiles.ps1`  
**Line:** 43

**Problem:** `Remove-Job` threw "job not finished" errors, causing exceptions that blocked batch continuation.

**Solution:** Added `-Force` and error suppression:
```powershell
# OLD (v7.4):
Remove-Job -Name $Job

# NEW (v7.5):
Remove-Job -Name $Job -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

### 3. Parallelism Optimization
**File:** `Modules/Private/2.ProcessingFunctions/Start-ARIProcessJob.ps1`

**Rationale:** User upgraded container from ~1 core/2GB to 2.0 cores/4GB RAM

**Changes:**
- **Regular environments:** 5 ‚Üí 8 jobs (+60%)
- **Medium environments:** 4 ‚Üí 6 jobs (+50%)
- **Large environments:** 3 ‚Üí 5 jobs (+67%)
- **Heavy mode:** 3 ‚Üí 5 jobs (+67%)

**Log identifier:** `‚öôÔ∏è  Parallel job limit set to 8 (v7.5: optimized for upgraded 2-core container)`

## Previous Execution Analysis (v7.4 - Oct 8, 17:35:48)

### What Worked ‚úÖ
- All 16 resource modules processed successfully
- Batch processing worked: 5+5+5+1 = 16 modules
- Jobs completed without hanging
- Cache files created successfully

### What Failed ‚ùå
- Excel file generation failed
- Error: `WARNING: Could not find /data/AzureResourceInventory/AzureResourceInventory_20251008_173548_Report_2025-10-08_17_36.xlsx`
- Jobs completed TOO FAST (2-3 seconds per batch)

### Root Cause Analysis
Jobs completed extremely quickly, suggesting:
1. Jobs may have failed silently without processing resources
2. Cache files may have been empty/invalid
3. No Excel sheets were created from cache data
4. `Start-ARIExcelExtraData` tried to open non-existent file

**This is likely unrelated to our v7.5 fixes** - it appears to be a data processing issue, not a batch continuation issue.

## Expected v7.5 Behavior

### Batch Processing (8 jobs per batch)
1. **Batch 1:** AI, Analytics, APIs, Compute, Container, Database, Hybrid, Integration (8 jobs)
2. **Batch 2:** IoT, Management, Monitoring, Network_1, Network_2, Security, Storage, Web (8 jobs)

### Log Markers to Watch For
```
‚öôÔ∏è  Parallel job limit set to 8 (v7.5: optimized for upgraded 2-core container)
üìä Processing all 16 resource type modules for complete inventory
```

### Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ Both batches complete with all 16 modules
- ‚úÖ Jobs run for reasonable duration (not 2-3 seconds)
- ‚úÖ Excel file gets created successfully
- ‚úÖ All ~587 resources appear in report
- ‚úÖ Multiple worksheets (30+) in Excel file

## Next Steps

### 1. Test v7.5 Execution
Trigger a new inventory run and monitor for:
- Correct v7.5 log messages
- 8 jobs per batch (not 5)
- Reasonable execution time per job
- Successful Excel file generation

### 2. If Jobs Still Complete Too Fast
This indicates a different issue (not batch continuation):
- Check if resources are being extracted properly
- Verify Azure authentication is working
- Examine individual job outputs
- Check cache file contents

### 3. Compare with Local Execution
- Your local run shows 587 resources across all types
- Container should match this output
- If not, there's a resource extraction/authentication issue

## Version History

| Version | Parallelism | Status | Issue |
|---------|-------------|---------|-------|
| v7.2 | 20 jobs | ‚ùå Hung | Jobs hung after 20 minutes |
| v7.3 | 10 jobs | ‚ùå Hung | Jobs hung after 5 minutes |
| v7.4 | 5 jobs | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Batch continuation bug, only processed first batch (fixed) |
| v7.5 | 8 jobs | ‚úÖ Deployed | All fixes applied, optimized for 2-core container |

## Verification Commands

```powershell
# Check deployed image
az containerapp show --name azure-resource-inventory --resource-group rg-rkibbe-2470 --query "properties.template.containers[0].image" -o tsv

# Check current revision
az containerapp revision list --name azure-resource-inventory --resource-group rg-rkibbe-2470 --query "[0].name" -o tsv

# View logs
az containerapp logs show --name azure-resource-inventory --resource-group rg-rkibbe-2470 --follow
```

## Key Differences: v7.4 vs v7.5

| Aspect | v7.4 | v7.5 |
|--------|------|------|
| Parallelism | 5 jobs | 8 jobs |
| Batch continuation | ‚ùå Broken | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| Remove-Job handling | ‚ùå Error prone | ‚úÖ Force flag added |
| Container resources | 1 core/2GB | 2 cores/4GB |
| Log message | "ultra-conservative mode" | "optimized for upgraded 2-core container" |
