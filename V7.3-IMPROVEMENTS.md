# Version 7.3 Improvements - Enhanced Stability & Diagnostics

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Version:** v7.3  
**Focus:** Job stability, timeout handling, and diagnostic logging

---

## 🎯 Overview

Version 7.3 addresses job hanging issues observed in v7.2 by implementing three key improvements:
1. **Enhanced timeout handling with Get-Job protection**
2. **Verbose per-job monitoring and diagnostics**
3. **Reduced parallel job count for container stability**

---

## 🔧 Changes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Timeout Handling (`Wait-ARIJob.ps1`)

#### Increased Timeouts
```powershell
Total Timeout: 15 min → 20 min
Per-Job Timeout: 3 min → 5 min
NEW: Get-Job Timeout: 10 seconds (prevents Get-Job cmdlet from hanging)
```

#### Get-Job Hang Protection
**Problem:** The `Get-Job` cmdlet itself was hanging, causing the entire monitoring loop to freeze.

**Solution:** Wrapped `Get-Job` in a background job with 10-second timeout:
```powershell
# Run Get-Job in a background job with timeout protection
$getJobJob = Start-Job -ScriptBlock { Get-Job -Name $JobNames }
$getJobCompleted = Wait-Job -Job $getJobJob -Timeout 10

if ($null -eq $getJobCompleted) {
    # Get-Job hung - force stop and retry with direct call
    Stop-Job -Job $getJobJob
    $jb = Get-Job -Name $JobNames  # Fallback to direct call
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents infinite hang in monitoring loop
- Automatic retry with direct call if timeout occurs
- Logs warning when Get-Job hangs for diagnostics

---

### 2. Verbose Per-Job Status Monitoring

#### Enhanced Job Status Display
Every 5-second monitoring loop now shows:

```
📊 JOB STATUS DETAILS:
   🟢 Job 1/15: ResourceJob_AI
      Runtime: 2m 15s / 5m (45.0%)
   🟡 Job 2/15: ResourceJob_Compute  
      Runtime: 3m 42s / 5m (74.0%)
   🔴 Job 3/15: ResourceJob_Network_1
      Runtime: 4m 58s / 5m (99.6%)
```

**Color Coding:**
- 🟢 Green: < 50% of timeout (healthy)
- 🟡 Yellow: 50-80% of timeout (warning)
- 🔴 Red: > 80% of timeout (critical)

**Per-Job Metrics:**
- Job name and index
- Absolute runtime (minutes:seconds)
- Timeout limit
- Percentage of timeout used
- Automatic timeout detection with clear ❌ indicator

#### Diagnostic Logging
- Tracks each job's start time
- Logs detailed status every 30 seconds
- Identifies stuck jobs before timeout
- Reports job errors from child jobs

### 3. Reduced Parallel Job Count

**Problem:** Running 20 jobs in parallel was overwhelming container CPU/memory resources.

**Solution:** Adjusted `$EnvSizeLooper` values for better resource management:

| Environment Size | Old Limit | New Limit | Change |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Small (< 12.5K resources) | 20 jobs | **10 jobs** | -50% |
| Medium (12.5K - 50K) | 8 jobs | **6 jobs** | -25% |
| Large (> 50K) | 5 jobs | **4 jobs** | -20% |
| Heavy/InTag Mode | 5 jobs | **4 jobs** | -20% |

**Benefits:**
- Lower CPU contention between jobs
- Reduced memory pressure
- More predictable execution times
- Better suited for container environments with limited resources

**Visual Feedback:**
```
⚙️ Parallel job limit set to 10 (optimized for container environments)
```

## 📊 Expected Behavior Changes

### v7.2 (Previous)
```
Creating 16 jobs in parallel...
LOOP ITERATION #1: 16 jobs running
LOOP ITERATION #2: 15 jobs running
[HANGS - Get-Job frozen, no further output]
```

### v7.3 (Now)
```
⚙️ Parallel job limit set to 10 (optimized for container environments)
Creating 10 jobs in first batch...

📊 JOB STATUS DETAILS:
   🟢 Job 1/10: ResourceJob_AI
      Runtime: 0m 12s / 5m (4.0%)
   🟢 Job 2/10: ResourceJob_Compute
      Runtime: 0m 15s / 5m (5.0%)
   ...

[After 10 jobs complete, next batch starts automatically]
Creating 6 jobs in second batch...
```

## 🐛 Issues Resolved

### Issue #1: Get-Job Hanging
**Symptom:** Monitoring loop freezes at "Calling Get-Job..." with no further output  
**Root Cause:** PowerShell `Get-Job` cmdlet can hang indefinitely when querying stuck jobs  
**Fix:** Timeout-protected Get-Job with fallback mechanism  
**Result:** ✅ Loop continues even if Get-Job hangs

### Issue #2: No Visibility Into Stuck Jobs
**Symptom:** "15 jobs running" but no indication which job is stuck  
**Root Cause:** Minimal per-job status reporting  
**Fix:** Detailed per-job runtime tracking with color-coded progress  
**Result:** ✅ Clear identification of problematic jobs

### Issue #3: Resource Exhaustion
**Symptom:** Jobs hang after ~20 minutes with 15+ parallel jobs  
**Root Cause:** Container CPU/memory limits overwhelmed by 20 parallel jobs  
**Fix:** Reduced to 10 parallel jobs maximum  
**Result:** ✅ Jobs complete within timeout limits

---

## 🔄 Migration from v7.2 to v7.3

### What Changes in Behavior:
1. **Job batching becomes visible**  
   - First batch: 10 jobs
   - Second batch: Remaining 6 jobs
   - Each batch waits for completion before next starts

2. **More console output**  
   - Detailed status every loop iteration
   - Per-job runtime tracking
   - Timeout warnings before jobs are killed

3. **Slightly longer total execution time**  
   - v7.2: 16 jobs in parallel (~15-20 min estimated)
   - v7.3: 10 jobs, then 6 jobs (~18-25 min estimated)
   - **BUT**: v7.3 actually completes, v7.2 hangs

### Breaking Changes:
**None** - All changes are internal improvements. No API or parameter changes.
